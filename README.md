# Attendance-Check
Check the presence of a name in a .txt list and it creates an excel column with a 1 ( for attendance and so if the person was in the list ) or with a 0 otherwise. The excel list represents the people expected to attend that event or lecture while the .txt is the file in which the names of the real attendances are written.
