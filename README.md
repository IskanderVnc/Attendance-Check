# Attendance-Check
Check the presence of a name in a .txt list and it creates an Excel column with a 1 ( for attendance and so if the person was in the list ) or with nothing otherwise. The excel list represents the people expected to attend that event or lecture while the .txt is the file in which the names of the real attendances are written.
Ofcourse this is a just for fun type of project since the language used is C and it is not intended to work with Excel documents . Even though it actually works some compromises had to be accepted to execute certain operations ( for example I couldn't read properly the whole Excel document.xlsx so I extracted just the first two columns of the document with name and surname and transformed it into a CSV (Comma delimited) file(.csv) to read it and use it in my code).
